# Headshots-Only

This game is a code bootcamp practice excersize. 

It's an in-browser FPS game. 

Instructions: 
Shoot the baddies as they charge towards you.

Final game should look like this.

But first we will do a simple whack-a-mole to get there.

Upon thinking about the inherent violence of my original idea, I've decided to try something a little different... without changing the name. 

Now: You are a paparazi trying to take photo's of celebrities. You want HEADSHOTS ONLY. 

nvm I don't like that. I'm going full blown fps. 
It's gonna feel like a 90s arcade game. 

HeadShots Only: shoot the bad guys.
